## Internal volume/weight ratio preference of Coenobita clypeatus in Discovery Bay, Jamaica
Regressive analysis of Coenobita clypeatus hermit crabs in shell switching behaviors. Understanding of shell preference by hermit crabs was determined through experimental research. 

## Motivation
Understanding the hermit crabs wants for lighter shells shows the greater need to delegate energy elsewhere versus in carrying a heavier shell for protection. Biology typically is dictated by their ability to further genetic material, so sexual fitness over protection is a logical conclusion.
