## Conservation Across the United States
An evaluation of the location and category of species on the IUCN red list. Numerous data mining techniques used to prepare data and a classifier method to answer hypothesis question.

## Motivation
Animals come and go off the IUCN Red List, featuring species that are species of concern, endangered, threatened, and in recovery. Some improve and their numbers allow them to grow off the red list, others unfortunately are deemed extinct. Where in the continguous United States are the most species on the red list, and what types of animals are the most frequent on the list?
