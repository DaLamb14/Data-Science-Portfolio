## Predicting Future Ocean pH
Predictive Analysis using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. Data from 2011 to 2018 from NOAA mooring with pH values. Accuracy was 77% in testing group. 

## Motivation
Ocean pH is an imporant driver in Ocean Acidifcation, a process which is making ocean water more acidic. This is detrimental for coral reefs and phytoplankton that use calcium for their exoskeletons. The more acidic water tends to dissolve calium carbonate. These impacts can be felt globally in fisheries and other ocean related companies. Flattening the upward trend of ocean pH will maintain the health of numerous ocean ecosystems and businesses.

## Features
This project uses the LSTM model to learn and predict sections of historical ocean pH data. In addition, data preparation includes histograms, line graphs, augemented dikey-fuller tests, and data trasformations. Work was done in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
