# Data-Science-Portfolio
A collection of projects showcasing over eight years of educational experience within the data science and environmental science community. 

## Motivation
The amount of environmental data collected daily is immense and can be intimidating to explain. Through the experience with numerous statistical and computer science methods, I have sought to gain insights on this data. Results from these projects can help understand and predict future environmental conditions. These projects also stress the importance of the balance of humans and the planet, seeking to inform on the reduction of carbon dioxide and plastic use and how current uses are negatively impacting the world's oceans. With improved processes and thought patterns, the world can heal and we can be more nuturing versus harming to the planet.

## Features
These projects feature numerous statistcal avenues such as:

**R**

**Python**

**Tableau**

**PowerBI**

**Excel**

**Powerpoint**


In addition, these project have diversity in statistical methods which include:

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Predictive Analysis**

**Data Mining**

**Random Forest Classifier**

**Gaussian Mixture Model**

**Convolutional Neural Networks**

**Regression Analysis**

**Visualization Methods**

**Scientific Writing**
