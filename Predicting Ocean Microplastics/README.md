## Predicting Ocean Microplastics
Predictive Analysis using ARIMA methods. Data from 1991 to 2008 with pieces per km2 on east coast. 

## Motivation
Plastic is a wonderful disovery for industrialization, however, it is not a great discovery for the oceans. All plastic from the discovery of plastic in 1907 still exists today, unless burned. Because of the long break down process, the forgotted plastics often land in the ocean. With wave action and wind, these plastics break into microscopic pieces that are eaten by fish. These fish end up on our dinner plates and we end up ingesting the plastic we throw away. While not much research has been done on the effect on the plastic in our bodies, it has been damaging to smaller animals such as the fish we eat. If there is not a reduction of plastic or a better way of removing plastic from the environment, health concerns could appear in the oceans and in our bodies.

## Features
This project uses an ARIMA method of prediction. To achieve this, outlier removal methods include IQR were used, parameter hypertuning, and moving average modeling was performed.
