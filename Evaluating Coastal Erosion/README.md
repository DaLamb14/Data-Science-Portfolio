## Evaluating Coastal Erosion
Gaussian Mixture Model clustering technique to classify storm damage as low risk or high risk of coastal erosion. 

## Motivation
With increased demand for coastal homes, more natural protective ecosystems are being removed from the coastline. As a result, storms and flooding can have a more severe impact on towns that have removed these protective ecosystems. This clustering method aims to show the cutoff of low and high damage to be used as a guideline on which towns and cities may need to consider additional protective measures against extreme weather events.

## Features
This projects features a clustering method using Gaussian mixture models. This data was highly skewed so outlier detection tecniques were used to even out the data. Bimodal data in the histogram indicates a possible clustering nature of the data.
