## Coral Species Identifier

A series of convolutional neural networks with the aim to import images of coral texture or structure and accurately identify the species of coral in the image.


## Motivation

Numerous coral reefs around the world are struggling in the midst of climate change and ocean acidification. Research projects that are targeted at coral reefs often identify the species of corals within their research location. With the largest reef being around 133,000 square miles, this process can be lengthy. To reduce the man power and time needed to identify these species, this program is aimed to quicken the process. If research is able to be completed faster, aid can be administered faster and could be the difference between a coral reef living and dying.

## Features

The first step in this project is a binary convolutional neural network that determines if the image uploaded is a texture image of coral or structure image. Then, the second step would be entering those images to the appropriate second neural network based upon texture images or structure images. From the second stage, the species of coral is found.
