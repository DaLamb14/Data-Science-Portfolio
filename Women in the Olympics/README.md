## Women in the Olympics
Exploratory data analysis on number of women performing in the Olympics before and after the inclusion of women in the Olympic committee. Some change between number of women before this time versus after this time was determined by hypothesis test. 

## Motivation
While women have been able to compete in the Olympics starting in 1900, there was much less opporotunity for them to compete than men. It wasn't until 1990 when the first woman was elected onto the International Olympic Committee. Was there a difference in women events and the amount of women competing prior to this election versus after?
