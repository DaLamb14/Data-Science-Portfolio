## The American Dream: A Refugee’s Hope
Grouping of visualizations showcasing statistics on refugees incoming to the United States. In addition, an analysis of business incubators across the United States and how incentive programs focused on refugees could improve the outlook of refugees lives in the U.S. 

## Motivation
Refugee’s fleeing from their home country where the state of affairs has become unsafe find solace in acceptance into the United States. Those who choose to stay in the United States integrate into the workforce in a variety of ways. With the increased acceptance of refugee or recently integrated people by business incubators, a higher percentage of this demographic can become more successful in their transition into life in the United States.
